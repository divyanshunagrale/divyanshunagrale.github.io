<hr />
<p>Welcome to my corner of the internet!
Somehow I've found myself in a situation where I have to introduce myself to random strangers on the internet.</p>
<h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
<hr />
<p>Hi, I'm Divyanshu. That's it.
.
.
.
Well, I'm a 24 year old guy from Nagpur, India currently living in Bristol, UK.
Kinda tech savvy. Kinda introverted.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-this-website">What is this website?</h2>
<hr />
<p>I don't know. Seemed like techy thing to do. And I had time on my hands. So this is it. My personal website. I might have already forgotten about it by the time you are be reading this.</p>
<h2 id="why-have-a-blog">Why have a blog?</h2>
<hr />
<p>I don't know. Seemed like something a personal website should have. I'll try to keep writing blogs for as long as I can. I have something on there for now, hopefully it'll turn into many <em>(interesting? jury's still out on that one)</em> things.  I might have already forgotten about it by the time you are be reading this.</p>
<h2 id="likes-and-dislikes">Likes (and Dislikes?)</h2>
<hr />
<p>Finally, something to show off my <em>(very limited)</em> personality!</p>
<p><strong>Likes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Anime and manga</li>
<li>Good music</li>
<li>Cooking (<em>mostly Indian food</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dislikes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>UK weather <em>(summers are the only saving grace)</em></li>
<li>*Most* social media</li>
</ul>
