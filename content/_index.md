# Divyanshu Nagrale
___

Welcome to my corner of the internet!
Somehow I've found myself in a situation where I have to introduce myself to random strangers on the internet.

## About me
___
Hi, I'm Divyanshu. That's it.

.
Well, I'm a 24 year old guy from Nagpur, India currently living in Bristol, UK. 
Kinda tech savvy. Kinda introverted. 

## What is this website?
___
I don't know. Seemed like techy thing to do. And I had time on my hands. So this is it. My personal website. I might have already forgotten about it by the time you are be reading this.

## Why have a blog?
___
I don't know. Seemed like something a personal website should have. I'll try to keep writing blogs for as long as I can. I have something on there for now, hopefully it'll turn into many *(interesting? jury's still out on that one)* things.  I might have already forgotten about it by the time you are be reading this.

## Likes (and Dislikes?)
___
Finally, something to show off my *(very limited)* personality!

**Likes:**
-   Anime and manga
-   Good music
-   Cooking (_mostly Indian food_)

**Dislikes:**
-   UK weather _(summers are the only saving grace)_
-   \*Most* social media
